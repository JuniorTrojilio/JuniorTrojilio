Just a curious developer living a great cycle of learning and practice. Admirer and enthusiast of technology, I was born in 1996, my father, a great computer and electronics technician, since childhood sharpened my taste for technology. Ever wonder how just sets of 1 and 0 can do so much? yes, it was precisely this curiosity that captivated me in studying Computer Engineering and dedicating myself to the world of bits, algorithms, logic, mathematics, structures and everything else that is more fascinating.

I study computer engineering, and I consider myself a good software engineer, but don't limit yourself to titles, as Linus torvalds says, "It's easy to talk, I want to see code".

"Hard work trumps talent, when talent doesn't work hard"
